In this project, user can input query and search through articles, reports and journals (upcoming) of Research Center of the Islamic Consultative. User must choose one of lexical search (search only within words themselves) or semantic search (search based on meaning of words). In addition, user must choose between searching on title, keywords (Persian and English), abstract and full text of docs. Searching by author, publish date, serial number and type of doc is also supported. In search results page, user can filter docs by related departments, sort them by date or similarity degree with input query. By clicking on every result, the user is redirected to details page for that.
